In this project, I:
●	Built a web application using Flask, to extract financial data (Revenue, Profit, Stock Symbol, Earnings Per Share) from news articles using OpenAI's Chat Completion API.

●	Developed an interactive web application using HTML, CSS and Flask.

Credits for project idea and overall code: CodeBasics - Youtube tutorial link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP_ZON_P4Ks

However, this tutorial is based on the previous version of OpenAI API.

The Chat Completion API code is different in the newer version. 

So, I used the following documentation for the current version:

https://platform.openai.com/docs/introduction

https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-generation/chat-completions-api


I have deleted part of the API key, from the "secret_key.py" file, which can be obtained from https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
